# Name : Zachary Hopps
# this is the beginning of my integration project
# this project is going to act as a Magic Eden NFT sniping bot
# ME (short for Magic Eden) is the largest, most popular NFT marketplace for
# NFTs on the Solana blockchain
# the purpose of a sniping bot is to quickly purchase NFTs listed far below the
# general floor price, on purpose or by accident, and allow the user of the bot
# to only buy into a project when they get the deal that they want, and is
# useful to potentially make someone a lot of money
# daytrading using a bot like this
# this bot will double as its own NFT, and the rights of using it will be sold
# and traded on magic eden one day after finalization.
